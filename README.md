## Features

* Micro MVC Blok based on Laravel Framework
* Can be used in any kind of application (Wordpress, Api, etc.)

## Getting started

This is a micro MVC framework based on Laravel. Please keep in mind that if you need more complex app => you should better use Laravel directly.

### Requirements

- PHP > 5.3
- [Composer](http://www.getcomposer.org)

### Installation

```bash
$ composer require arx/mmvc

# To create a micro mvc project

$ vendor/arx/mmvc/bin/arx new $$where_your_app_path_goes ex: app => will put folder inside app folder $$

```

### How to use it

- There is basically 3 files to be aware of : 

* index.php # load everything and put a caller
* bootstrap.php # This is where you can add a ServiceProvider or your Facade depends on your need
* routes.php # Put your routes logic here

Everything else is almost the same than a classic Laravel Project.

/!\ The approache here is to have a blazzing fast micro-mvc and just what you need in most of case

If your app is more complexe, you should considere to use directly a Laravel Project instead !

### Advanced
